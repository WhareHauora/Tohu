# Whare Hauora - How we work?
A shared repository of how we work both internally and externally. 

We use [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) to update our Tohu. 

```We'd like to do a shout out to [Figure.nz](http://figure.nz), who we consider our tuakana. Our tohu is based off their [tohu.figure.nz](http://tohu.figure.nz) model and we appreciate their leadership```
